## Python Unix Cat example

cat is a standard Unix utility that reads files sequentially, writing them to standard output.

cat can be used to pipe a file to a program that expects plain text or binary data on its input stream. cat does not destroy non-text bytes when concatenating and outputting. As such, its two main use cases are text files and certain format-compatible types of binary files.
